       you see there is a param called "robot_description", if we don't use group ns, two robot_description will collide
       After added group ns, you need to change the value of 'Robot Description' to $(namespace)/racecar.xacro in RobotModel in Rviz
       Otherwise, an error will occur which said robot_description not found:

         but when Rviz initialize the car model, Rviz will try to find corresponding tf name in xacro file,
